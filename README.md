# Wish-Friend-List

## Project description
> It has happened to anyone that they do not know what to give at an event or that they do not know what to give someone occasionally, which is why a solution known as Wish Lists was proposed, which we find on sites like Amazon or Liverpool. However, it is not an optimal solution, since it is handled through links that are very tedious to save or even spread, in addition to the fact that it is limited only to products from your store. That is why Wish Friend List will have a follow-up system so that at any time you can take into account the wishes of your closest friends or relatives, and even of people with whom you do not have a close relationship. Objectives, which are desired to be achieved with the development of the project:

* Facilitate the knowledge of the ideal gifts for any event and for any host.
* Keep the user aware of important events that are coming up or that they may attend.
* A somewhat romantic objective that we have in Wish Friend List is that any mother or family member can know what to pamper her child with on a special date.
* Connect to many people who can even meet and make friends because they have the same tastes.
* It is expected that the application can make the exclusion of people to events much less
